# Performace-optimizing-in-Diagonal-Matrix-Multiplication
We have to reduce the execution time for diagonal matrix multiplication. We can use many concepts like loop unrolling, loop nested optimization and many other things. 

# Problem Statement
Input: Two N*N matrices. N = 2^{K}, where K is a natural number.
Output: An array of length 2N-1
